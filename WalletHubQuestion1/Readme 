Read me for Assignment 1 


I have used Cucumber-Selenium combination for testing Scenario1. 
I would like to mention some advantages why this framework was chosen :

- Since our main motive is the tests should be simple , maintainable and easily understandable hence this was
the preferrred language 

- Collaboration between Business stakeholders, Business Analysts, QA Team and developers
