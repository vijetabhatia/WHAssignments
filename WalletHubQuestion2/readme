Read me for assignment 2

This assignment has selenium webdriver with Junit in Page Object model

Why this combination was chosen ?

- Clean Code : Page Object Model ensures that operations and flows should be separated from Verification. 
			   This ensures code cleaner and easy to understand
- Reusability : Since the object repositery is independent of the test logic and cases , the same model can be 
				resused for other tools/frameworks as well
- Less and more optimized code
